    <h1>Dear Eee Hyun,</h1>
    <p>On this special day of White Day, I find myself reflecting on how much joy and brightness you bring into my life. Every moment spent with you is a treasure, a beautiful blend of laughter, love, and countless memories that I hold dear to my heart.</p>
    <p>Your presence is like a warm and gentle light that guides me through my darkest days. The kindness in your eyes and the sweetness of your smile remind me daily of how lucky I am to have you by my side.</p>
    <p>As we celebrate this day together, I want to promise you once more that my heart belongs to you. I look forward to creating more beautiful moments with you, exploring the world hand in hand, and supporting each other through all of life's adventures.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being you, for sharing your love with me, for inspiring me to accept myself, for helping me see the unique beauty in imperfection, for showing me that love is something you do; something not just to be said, but also to be shown.</p>
    <p>I love you more than words can express, and I'm excited for all that our future holds. Happy White Day, my love.</p>
