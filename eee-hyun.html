    <h1>Dear Eee Hyun,</h1>
<p>Since we first met, there's been this special connection between us. We spent our first day together like we were long-lost friends, laughing and talking for hours. Beyond your stunning beauty, you have a kindness that's truly rare. I feel so lucky to have you in my life.</p>

<p>If you could see yourself through my eyes, you'd realize how truly beautiful you areâ€”inside and out. Your kindness shines brightly, making everything around you better.</p>

<p>Getting to know you, including your culture, has been an incredible journey. I'm thrilled about the future, the memories we'll make, and all the joy we'll share. Being with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.</p>

<p>If you have time, will you be my Valentine?</p>

<div class="signature">Yours forever,<br>Jay</div>
